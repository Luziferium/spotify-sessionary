# spotify-sessionary
A Spotify addon made in Java.

## Whats the purpose?
The purpose of this is to make Spotify hearing-sessions for free. Since the discords "hear together" is kinda bad and the group-sessions of Spotify are premium- and mobile-only, I've decided to create this Java desktop app to provide a possibilty to hear the same songs together - live.

## How *should* it be done?
Host-Client -> Proxy -> Listener-Clients
*or*
Any Listener-Client -> Proxy -> Hearlist -> Next Song Information -> Every Listener-Client
